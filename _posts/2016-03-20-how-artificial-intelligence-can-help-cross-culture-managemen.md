Almost 90 percent of top executives named "cross-cultural leadership" as their greatest management challenge for this century, according to a recent survey of senior leaders from 68 countries.

Have you had difficulty in communicating with colleagues from different parts of the world? 

Have you encountered challenges meeting project deadlines due to differing sense of time among international team members? 

Culture matters more than ever in a world where the frequency of cross-border collaborations and initiatives is increasing at lightning speed. 

To drive success in such an interconnected world, one must understand how the beliefs and assumptions of a culture shape the way individuals within it communicate and operate, and how that may be quite different from the way you communicate and operate within your culture. 

In today's business world and even more so in the future, you will need to learn how to understand what is behind cultural barriers and develop targeted communication and management strategies to overcome those barriers, enabling you to deliver greater business success in today's "global village." 

The XCAI machine also learns from researchers across the world. 

Eventually, XFCAI wants to act as an assistant in different fields of science. For example, it could scan hundreds of thousands of cross cultural documents and articles in an instant to provide managers with immediate suggestions on recommended strategies to their questions.

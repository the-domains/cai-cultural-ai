  Almost 90 percent of top executives named “cross-cultural leadership” as their
  greatest management challenge for this century, according to a recent survey of
  senior leaders from 68 countries.

  —“The Economist” Intelligence Unit, 2011.

  Have you had difficulty in communicating with colleagues from different parts
  of the world? Have you encountered challenges meeting project deadlines due to
  differing sense of time among international team members? Culture matters more
  than ever in a world where the frequency of cross-border collaborations and
  initiatives is increasing at lightning speed. To drive success in such an
  interconnected world, one must understand how the beliefs and assumptions of
  a culture shape the way individuals within it communicate and operate, and how
  that may be quite different from the way you communicate and operate within
  your culture. In this course, you will learn to understand what is behind
  cultural barriers and develop targeted communication and management strategies
  to overcome those barriers, enabling you to deliver greater business success in
  today’s “global village."
